# Uncommon Dart Bug: Misuse of `rethrow` in Asynchronous Operations

This repository demonstrates a subtle but important bug related to the `rethrow` keyword in Dart's asynchronous programming model.  The core issue revolves around how exceptions are handled and propagated through asynchronous functions.

The `bug.dart` file contains a function `fetchData` that fetches data from an API.  The example shows how improper `rethrow` handling can hinder debugging.

The `bugSolution.dart` file offers a corrected version, emphasizing proper exception handling and the strategic use of `rethrow`.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.dart` and observe the output in the console. Note that it prints the exception, and rethrows it, leading to difficulties when debugging unless handled properly up the call stack.
3. Run `bugSolution.dart` to see the improved error handling.

## Learning Points

* The importance of clear exception handling in asynchronous operations.
* The correct usage of `rethrow` to maintain a clean exception flow.
* Best practices for debugging asynchronous code in Dart.
